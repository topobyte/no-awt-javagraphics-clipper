## About

This project is a port of the `Clipper` class from
[Javagraphics](https://javagraphics.java.net) to the
[NoAwt library](https://github.com/topobyte/no-awt).
Only the parts of the Javagraphics source code that were necessary for
the `Clipper` class to compile have been included in this project.
